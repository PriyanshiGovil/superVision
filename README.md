# superVision – Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Real-Time Security

> "superVision doesn't just watch the world — it protects it."

Every moment, somewhere in the world, violence breaks out — a fight in a school corridor, a road accident on a highway, or even an act of arson in a public space.  
The question is — will someone notice in time?
We built a system that does.

## ❗ The Problem

Most surveillance systems are just passive witnesses.  
They see everything — but act on nothing.  
And by the time a human watches the footage, the damage is already done.

---

## ✅ The Solution

Introducing superVision — an intelligent real-time anomaly detection system that watches through a camera lens and instantly recognizes violent or abnormal events like:

- 🔥 Arson  
- 🥊 Fighting & Assault  
- 🚗 Road Accidents  
- 🧱 Vandalism  
- ...and more — all trained from real-world data

---

##  How It Works

 superVision analyzes every video frame in real time and classifies it as either normal or anomalous.

📩 When violence or abnormal activity is detected, the system sends instant SMS and email alerts to pre-registered users or authorities, including:

- 📸 Captured frame  
- 📍 Location (customizable)  
- ⏰ Timestamp of the event  

This ensures that help arrives faster than ever.
